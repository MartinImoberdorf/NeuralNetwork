ðŸ§  Neural Network (G to KG) ðŸ§ 

The NeuralNetwork (G to KG) is a simple implementation of a neural network that converts weights in grams to kilograms. It utilizes the TensorFlow and NumPy libraries to build and train the neural network model.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the NeuralNetwork (G to KG) works:

Import the necessary libraries: The program starts by importing TensorFlow and NumPy, which are essential for building and training the neural network.

Data preparation: The program requires a dataset consisting of input values in grams and their corresponding output values in kilograms. This dataset is used to train the neural network. The data is typically split into training and testing sets.

Model architecture: The neural network model is defined, specifying the number of input neurons (1 in this case, representing the weight in grams), hidden layers (optional), and output neurons (1 in this case, representing the weight in kilograms). The number of hidden layers and neurons can be adjusted based on the complexity of the problem.

Model training: The model is trained using the training dataset. The weights and biases of the neural network are adjusted iteratively through a process called backpropagation. This process involves feeding the input values into the network, comparing the predicted output with the actual output, and updating the network's parameters to minimize the prediction error.

Model evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the testing dataset. This helps assess how well the neural network generalizes to new data and avoids overfitting.

Prediction: Finally, the trained model can be used to make predictions on new input data (weights in grams). By passing the input through the trained neural network, it predicts the weight in kilograms.

Overall, the NeuralNetwork (G to KG) demonstrates the application of neural networks in converting weights from grams to kilograms. By leveraging TensorFlow and NumPy, it provides an efficient and accurate way to perform this conversion.
